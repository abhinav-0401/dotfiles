# Dotfiles for NeoVim and Shell

### The repo uses GNU Stow to manage the symlinks for the dotfiles right now. 
### I haven't found a better, less cumbersome way yet, and tbh this doesn't trouble me enough to search for one.

### The NeoVim config being used right now is a modified kickstarter.lua config (created by TJ of telescope.nvim fame)
### I am way too lazy to write my own config and way too snobby to use something like NvChad.
### A modded kickstarter is the sweet spot.

### The bashrc is not very special, a couple of aliases for very frequently used commands and the prompt that I have been using for a while now,
### which almost mimics cyan with terminal colours.
